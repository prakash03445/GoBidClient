# GoBidClient

**GoBidClient** is the interactive CLI client for **[GoBid](https://github.com/prakash03445/GoBid)** — a real-time auction system built in Go using gRPC.

## Usage

Run the client with:

```bash
go run main.go

> ⚠️ Note: This CLI client currently lacks some features. For more control, you can use gRPC API tools like Postman or grpcurl. The client will be updated with more features soon.
